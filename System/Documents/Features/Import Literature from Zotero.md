# Import Literature from Zotero

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please ensure Zotero is open before using this feature. 

This feature allows you to import highlighted notes, screenshots, and preliminary academic tags from Zotero. 

Using the Obsidian Plugin: **Zotero Integration**, you can extract metadata from Zotero references. For citation-related properties, you can supplement formats with the Zotero Add-on: **Better BibTeX for Zotero**. These details are then inserted into templates generated by the Obsidian Plugin: **Templater**, enabling you to quickly import your notes.
